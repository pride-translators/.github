Many LGBTQIA+ people get discriminated just because of who they are. And there aren't that many Korean translations when it comes to such topics. So this is where **Pride Translators** do their best to translate useful resources into Korean.

### What is LGBTQIA+?
- **L**esbian
- **G**ay
- **B**isexual
- **T**ransgender
- **Q**ueer/Questioning
- **I**ntersex
- **A**sexual

Hope this helps. :)
